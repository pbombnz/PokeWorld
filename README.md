# SWEN222 Group Assignment

## Team Members and Repsonsibilites
* Prashant Bhikhu - Networking / 'All Rounder'
* Alex (Zhen) Wang - Graphical User Interface and Extras
* Donald Tang (Team Leader) - Game Logic and Objects, Game Sprite Making, JUnit Testing
* Sushant Balajee - Game Logic and Objects
* Priyanka Bhula  - Game Saving and Loading (via JSON)

## Note For Assignment Marker
Due to our Eclispe Git glitches, we discovered a problem where commits from Sushant and Alex weren't associated with their GitHub accounts but infact an unknown account and someone else's git account respectively. Therefore on commit log inspection, any commits made by an unknown account "sushantbalajee" (account is not linked to a profile) are indeed sushant's commitment and commits made by "raltu" are infact Alex. 

## Unknown Repsonsiblities
* ? - Documentation (Class Diagram and CSC Cards)

## How to Execute
1. Launch Executable By Running the Main Method in the Main Class in the Main Package.
2. In the Game menu, Click "Create Game (As Server)"
3. Then go back the main frame, In the Game menu, "Join Game (as Client)"
4. Play!

## Git Rules (For Team Members)
1. When you open Eclipse, make sure the first thing you do before coding is 'pull' so you are synced with the remote server.
2. Make sure you are not editing the same file as someone else. Announce that you have pushed or currently editing in the group, so we can avoid touching that file, and it gives us an alert we will need to 'push' and 'pull' soon.
3. Do not touch other team member's packagages without their permission. 
4. Remeber to commit regularly so we can see your activity on the project.
