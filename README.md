## Git Rules
1. When you open eclipse, make sure the first thing you do before coding is 'pull' so you are synced.
2. Make sure you are not editing the same file as someone else. Announce that you have pushed or currently editing in the group, so we can avoid conflicting that file, and it gives us an alert we will need to 'push' and 'pull'
3. DO NOT touch other team member's packagages without their permission.
4. Remeber to commit regularly so we can see your activity on the project. Commiting to the last minute is a bad idea, instead commit everytime you make a relatively big or 'one-off' change.
